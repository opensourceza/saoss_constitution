SAOSS wanst to register as an NGO so that it has recognition within South Africa to represent the interests of open source software/hardware. One of the requirements is to have an approved constition. Other requirements as as per https://www.gov.za/services/register-nonprofit-organisation.

# From the requirements website:
If yours is a non-profit organisation and is not part of government, you can apply for registration. You can submit your non-profit organisation (NPO) application at your nearest provincial  social development office.

NPOs include trusts, companies or other associations of persons established for a public purpose.

* community-based organisation (CBO)
* faith-based organisation (FBO).

Submit the completed NPO application form at your nearest provincial social development office together with two copies of the organisation’s founding documents:

* The founding documents of the NPO must meet the provisions of Section 12 (A-O) of the Nonprofit Organisations Act, 1997 (Act 71 of 1997).  If you fail to do that, your application will be rejected.

You can submit your application (no cost to register) at your nearest provincial Social Development office, post it to The Directorate, Non-profit organisations, Department of Social Development, Private Bag X901, Pretoria, 0001 or deliver it by hand to the Department of Social Development, 134 Pretorius Street, HSRC Building, Pretoria (or it seems at online link below).
